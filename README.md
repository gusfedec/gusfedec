- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gusfedec
I'm a backend/frontend developer. I started developing with PHP and 8 years ago I have been developing with Javascript, 
using frameworks and libraries such as AngularJs, Angular and ReactJs and NodeJs. 
I seek to adapt to new technologies that must be constantly faced in this environment.
